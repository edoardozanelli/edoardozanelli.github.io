Welcome to my Website! 

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Aarhus Center for Econometrics (ACE)](https://econ.au.dk/ace), Aarhus University.

I obtained my PhD in Economics at the University of Bologna, under the supervision of Prof. [Giuseppe Cavaliere](https://giuseppecavaliere.wixsite.com/giuseppe). 


My research is about Econometrics, with a specific focus on Nonparametric methods and Bootstrap inference. My current projects relate to:
<ul>
  <li>Bootstrap inference for nonlinear econometric models and asymptotically biased estimators.</li>
  <li>Inference for econometric models with parameters on the boundary of the parameter space.</li>
  <li>Specification testing for IV.</li>
  <li>Estimation of instabilities in the Phillips Curve.</li>
</ul>
