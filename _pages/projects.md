<p>- Improved Inference for Nonparametric regression and Regression Discontinuity Designs</a> (with <a href="https://giuseppecavaliere.wixsite.com/giuseppe">Giuseppe Cavaliere</a>, <a href="https://silvia-goncalves.research.mcgill.ca/">Sílvia Gonçalves</a>  & and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/mortennielsen">Morten Ørregaard Nielsen</a>).

<p><font size="-1"><u>Abstract</u>: We consider inference for (possibly) non-linear conditional expectations in the setup of
nonparametric regression and regression-discontinuity designs. In this context, inference
is challenging due to asymptotic bias of local polynomial estimators. We propose a novel
approach to restore valid inference by means of proper implementations of the bootstrap.
Specifically, we show conditions under which, even if the bootstrap test statistic is not able
to mimic the behavior of the asymptotic bias – making the bootstrap fail under standard
arguments – the large sample distribution of the bootstrap p-value only depends on some
nuisance parameters which are easily estimable. We introduce two bootstrap algorithms,
namely the local linear (LL) and local quadratic (LQ) bootstrap, which deliver asymptotically
valid confidence intervals (CIs) in both interior and boundary points without requiring
undersmoothing or direct bias correction. We demonstrate the theoretical validity and
analyze the efficiency properties of these methods, highlighting the asymptotic equivalence
of LQ bootstrap-based prepivoted CIs with robust bias correction (RBC) intervals, while
showing that LL bootstrap-based CIs achieve greater efficiency. Monte Carlo simulations
confirm the practical relevance of our methods.</font>

<p><font size="-1"><u>Abstract</u>: We propose a novel <em>local pairs bootstrap</em> (LPB) in the context of autoregressive models with stochastic time-varying coefficients. Asymptotic validity is established under general forms of (conditional and unconditional) heteroskedasticity. In the process, we also show asymptotic validity of a <em>fixed-regressor wild bootstrap</em> (FWB) and compare the finite sample properties of the  two methods, in the spirit of Gonçalves and Kilian (2004). We introduce a dynamic bandwidth to allow for local adaptive smoothing and provide two data-driven procedures for calibration. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations show that both bootstrap methods outperform the standard asymptotic estimator and that the LPB is generally preferable. Finally, we implement our theoretical findings to investigate the empirical issue of the evolution of inflation and expected inflation persistence.</font>

<p><font size="-1"><u>Abstract</u>: We provide a time-varying estimate of the parameters of the New Keynesian Phillips Curve (NKPC) by combining three recent contributions from the literature: (i) a non-parametric estimate of a vector auto-regressive model with time-varying parameters (ii) an identification of a demand shock based on the Excess Bond Premium  (iii) a regression-in-impulse-response-functions approach to compute the coefficients of structural macroeconomic equations. Our methodology allows to track the evolution of the NKPC coefficients over time, with a precision which would not be achieved by resorting to rolling windows estimation or simple splits of the sample. We show that, for the US, the structural slope of the NKPC has actually decreased over time and that this decline took place relatively early, with the slope being virtually zero from 1990 onward. Furthermore, we observe a growing importance of expected inflation. Our analysis also allows to dismiss the explanation of a flatter NKPC resorting to a stronger and faster reaction over time of the Federal Reserve to demand shocks. We also show results for the Euro Area and by using a different identification strategy based on sign-restrictions.</font>
